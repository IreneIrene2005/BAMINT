## Common Causes & Solutions

### ❌ **Problem 1: No File Selected**

   - Screenshot of Bank Transfer confirmation
   - Receipt from PayMaya

### ❌ **Problem 2: File Type Not Supported**

**Solution**:
The file must be one of these types:

- ✅ **PNG** (.png) - Image file
- ✅ **PDF** (.pdf) - Document file

**How to fix**:
- If you have a Word document (.doc, .docx) → Convert to PDF first
